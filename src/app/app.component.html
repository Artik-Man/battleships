    <h2>Battle ship test task</h2>
    <p>Preferably develop following task in Angular 7 with TypeScript.
      <a href="https://github.com/Artik-Man/battleships" target="_blank">Code on github</a>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Let's create an onscreen grid of cells aligned within a square 10 by 10.</li>
      <li>Then we set up initial battle ships - one L shaped, one I shaped and two dot shaped. Initial battle
        ships cannot overlap.</li>
      <li>Start actual game manually per play after any kind of user input which would simulate shots at
        random positions - any missed shot would indicate already hit area, any shot at any of initial ships
        would visually indicate that battle ship has sink (change of ship color would be fine enough). (note,
        no autoplay is needed)</li>
      <li>Program must be able to tell that all ships have sunk and game is over.
        Seems simple enough and will show some actual code and how does person handles UI
        development - which frameworks and language dialects he feels most comfortable with and stuff
        like that.</li>
      <li>Battle ships must not touch one another so there is at least a single cell between them. Any
        battle ship rotation must be random.
        Each ship must have outline color defining boundaries of a ship.</li>
      <li>Multi cell battle ships (I && L) must consist of 4 cells, so there is no ambiguity of L shapes that
        do not look like L and I shapes of more or less than 4 cells.</li>
    </ol>
